# calculator-project

This project will focus on creating an on-screen calculator by drawing on my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As the culmination of
the Odin Project Foundations Course, it should demonstrate my progress in learning the basic aspects of programming before I move onto 
a more focused Pathway. 

I am going to focus on function over form. While I want the calculator to be simple and usable, I'm not going to stress over the design
and worry about it being maximally visually appealing.  

I'm looking forward to challenging myself while building this. Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoy it!
